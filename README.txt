Hello! This is my first time making any sort of game besides Scratch so please bear with me.

In order to run this game, install Python in it's latest version. Then do windows + R, then type cmd, then in terminal type in pip install pygame.
This will allow the game to run when executed.

I love pokemon so I tried making the turn based RPG myself. I used Python and Pygame, originally for my school project.
I hope to get better as I continue my career in software and coding platforms so please send me any advice!

Thank you for trying this out. Criticsm is always welcome :>

Love,
Rose
